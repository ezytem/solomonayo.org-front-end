        <p>“Being successful and fulfilling your life’s purpose are not at all the same thing; You can reach all your personal goals, become a raving success by the world’s standard, and still miss your purpose in this life.”</p>
        <p>"We are products of our past, but we don't have to be prisoners of it."</p>
        <p>"The only really happy people are those who have learned how to serve."</p>
        <p>"God is not haphazard; he planned it all with great precision."</p>
        <p>"Love leaves a legacy. How you treated other people, not your wealth or accomplishments, is the most enduring impact you can leave on earth."</p>
        <p>"Resentment always hurts you more than it does the person you resent. While your offender has probably forgotten the offense and gone on with life, you continue to stew in your pain, perpetuating the past. Listen: those who hurt you in the past cannot continue to hurt you now unless you hold on to the pain through resentment. Your past is past! Nothing will change it. You are only hurting yourself with your bitterness. For your own sake, learn from it, and then let it go."</p>
        <p>"Experience is not what happens to you. It is what you do with what happens to you. Don’t waste your pain; use it to help others."</p>
        <p>"A pretentious, showy life is an empty life; a plain and simple life is a full life."</p>
        <p>"Life is a gift... Life is a test... Life is a temporary assignment."</p>
        <p>"Character is both developed and revealed by tests, and all of life is a test... You will be tested by major changes, delayed promises, impossible problems, unanswered prayers, undeserved criticism, and even senseless tragedies."</p>

        <p><strong>5 Signs Your Breakthrough Is Near</strong></p>
        <p>Have you been trusting God for a breakthrough? Are you tired of the enemies’ oppressions and earnestly hope that God will arise on your behalf? I need you to know that God has heard your voice. And now, your breakthrough is near. The big question you would love to ask is how will I know my breakthrough is near. Here are 5 signs that show you are very close to your breakthrough.</p>
        <p><strong>Number 1: Your Challenges Suddenly Increase.</strong></p>
        <p>This is the first sign that your breakthrough is near. Oftentimes, it’s like a progression, then suddenly escalating, and you’ll begin to think the world is against you. At such seasons of your life, all doors will look closed, problems upon problems, and life becomes really, really difficult. This is when you think God has left you to yourself. But that’s not true. God did not leave you. Instead, the devil only tries to resist you from entering your breakthrough. He wants to stop you from experiencing a new dawn.</p>
        <p>As a human, you will complain. You will feel like giving it all up. However, that’s not the right attitude. Instead, you must first remember that God’s eyes are upon you. Also, Romans 8:28 says, “And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose.”</p>
        <p>You need to realize that God has called you for a purpose. He has called you for a reason. Therefore, irrespective of how knotty the challenges can be, God has your back. That challenge is a stepping stone to your breakthrough.</p>
        <p><strong>Number 2: Exhaustion And Weariness.</strong></p>
        <p>I need you to know that you are not doing the wrong thing when you become weary on a journey. Don’t try to act like a Superman. However, you must remember that you serve the most powerful God. He’s able to strengthen you when you feel weak. So, when you feel tired, it’s a sign that you are near your freedom. You need to pray to God for the strength to keep going.</p>
        <p>You may be comfortable with your situation. This might be why you haven’t experienced any change in your life. You are struggling to eat twice a day but are satisfied with it. You don’t see any reason to pray about it. Your financial life is not improving, but this doesn’t look like a problem to you. Listen, the day you become weary of these problems is the day your breakthrough begins. Thus, being weary can be a good thing. It can serve as a catalyst for your breakthrough.</p>
        <p><strong>Number 3: Distractions</strong></p>
        <p>Distraction is a sign that your life is about to change forever. What are distractions? They simply refer to anything that can take your attention from your goal. They can debar you from pursuing your God-given dreams and aspirations. The devil will purposely place these things on your way to stop you from reaching your breakthrough. Distractions can start from your thoughts down to the problems in your life and even people.</p>
        <p>God might have placed a beautiful idea in your mind. He had decided to make this the gateway to your financial freedom. But when you share this with your friends, they can decide to open your eyes to things that won’t work. They will list out all the obstacles on the way. All these are mere distractions. When you encounter them on your divine-ordained path, identify them and shift your focus to the positive things.</p>
        <p>You might have spent hours praying. You have fasted for days. God has assured you that He has answered your prayers. However, the devil matches forward with temptations. You must be wise enough to know that this temptation is to stop you from claiming your blessings. It is a deceptive distraction. You must not fall for it. Joseph understood this. His master’s wife tried to distract him from achieving his purpose. What did Joseph do? He ran! That is what you need to do as well. You must run when you encounter a distraction. Face your goal. Sooner than later, you will experience a breakthrough.</p>
        <p><strong>Number 4: When People Began To Leave Your Life.</strong></p>
        <p>Deep relationships are hard to break. This is due to the sacrifices that you’ve invested in it. But the truth is, you don’t need some people in your life. When your breakthrough draws near, they will have no choice but to leave. This might be very painful. You might not even see any reason for them to leave. However, God knows that they can’t accommodate your blessings. They might influence it negatively. Thus, they need to leave. So, when you notice the sudden departure of people from your life, this could be a sign that something new is about to happen to you.</p>
        <p>You don’t need pessimistic people. They will never lead you to think positively. You don’t need deceivers. They will never share the truth with you. You don’t need individuals that will always lead you to sin against God. Why? They will stop you from experiencing Him in new dimensions. Therefore, avoid clinging on and lean on God. Let God be your assistance and helper. Don’t assume you can’t do without somebody. You need only God and his breath to live. When you let go of these relationships and face God, He will perform your long-awaited miracle.</p>
        <p><strong>Number 5: Your Sense The Urge To Pray And Praise God More Than Before.</strong></p>
        <p>When the manifestation of your breakthrough is close by, you will yearn to draw closer to God. You will begin to feel the need to spend more time in prayer. Perhaps you’ve been spending an hour praying. But when your breakthrough draws near, you will feel a strong urge to pray even more. When you do this, God will open His plans for you. He will open you to new realms in the spirit.</p>
        <p>Before your breakthrough appears physically, God would have perfected it spiritually. God will do nothing on earth except man ask Him. Thus, if you want God to move in your life, you must be ready to ask Him earnestly. You should be ready to pray until something happens.</p>
        <p>You will also have the urge to praise God more. Why? It is the Spirit of God working in you to do the right thing. Many breakthroughs happen through praise. The Bible says in Philippians 4:6, “Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God”. This verse listed all that you can do to get your answers. So, when you’ve prayed and nothing happens, try praises. Gratitude is one of the potent keys to your freedom.</p>
